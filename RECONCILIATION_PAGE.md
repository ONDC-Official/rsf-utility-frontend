## Navigation
To access the Reconciliation page:
1. Start the application: `npm start`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click on "Reconciliation" in the left sidebar
4. The page will load with the Reconciliation Manager interface

## File Structure
- **Component**: `src/pages/Reconciliation/index.tsx`
- **Styles**: `src/styles/pages/Reconciliation.styled.ts`
- **Routing**: Updated `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx`

## Styling
The page uses Material-UI components with custom styled components to match the design:
- Clean, modern interface with card-based layout
- Consistent color scheme with the rest of the application
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Proper spacing and typography hierarchy

## Data
The page currently uses mock data that matches the reference image:
- 5 sample reconciliation records
- 5 sample outgoing request records
- Realistic error messages and status values
- Proper formatting for currency values (â‚¹)

## Next Steps
To make this fully functional, you would need to:
1. Connect to real API endpoints for data fetching
2. Implement actual functionality for the action buttons
3. Add form handling for the "Generate Recon Request" feature
4. Implement the "Review Recon Requests" tab content
5. Add proper error handling and loading states
